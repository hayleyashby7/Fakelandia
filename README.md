# Justice for Fakelandia ⚖️

## Introduction 🧑‍⚖️

The faraway country of Fakelandia has decided to modernise their justice system with a fancy new technology: "websites".

Fakelandia is a happy place with a low crime rate, but it's important to each citizen that justice is seen to be served, so they'd like a website to keep abreast of the latest justice developments.

## Crimes and Misdemeanours

The Fakelandians have asked for a site that lets them browse lists of crimes committed today, and also for functionality that helps citizens confess to their own crimes.

As a non-citizen, you might not be aware that there are only four possible crimes in Fakelandia:

-   Mild Public Rudeness
-   Speaking in a Lift
-   Not Eating Your Vegetables
-   Supporting Manchester United

Despite the clear severity of some of these awful crimes, the Fakelandians refer to them all as "misdemeanours".

### Running client and server together

👉 Run `npm start` in the root folder to start up both server and app.

When the server starts should see a little welcome message in your terminal:

![Server Welcome](./docs/images/server_welcome.jpg 'Server welcome message')

👉 In your browser, navigate to the health check route `http://localhost:8080/health`

You should see a message:

"👍 Okay! The server is responding! 🙌"

You should then be able to access the default application by opening the browser and visiting

`http://localhost:5134`
